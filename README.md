# slip
Simulation of a reduced-order biped model in Matlab/Simulink.

Models the biped as a biped mass/inertia with two damped spring legs, each with an angle and length actuator. Foot mass, motor inertia, gearboxes, motor damping, and ground properties are included in the model.

# Usage
Requires Matlab and Simulink 2016b. To run the simulation, first run the script `biped_setup.m`, then start the simulink model `biped_sim.slx`.
